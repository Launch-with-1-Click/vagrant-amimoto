# Vagarnt WordPress (Amimoto)

## Description

Amimoto WordPressStack greatly simplifies the development and management of WordPress hosting.
WordPress is a content management platform that allows users to easily publish, manage, and organize a wide variety of content on a website.
Amimoto Stack includes ready-to-run versions of WordPress. It is completely integrated and configured, so youâ€™ll be ready to start developing your WordPress as soon as the AMI is launched onto Amazon EC2.
